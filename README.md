# Titanic-Machine-Learning

This was a fun project that helps predicts survivability on the Titanic. In this project, I am exposed to Pycaret and Catboost for the first time. Pycaret was very simple to use to incorporate all the different types of models used in this project.

Some of the machine learning models I used include Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian, Decision Trees, Ridge Classifiers, CatBoost, etc. 

For all the graphs produced in the visualization section, we used Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

My submission resulted in a 77.51% success rate in predicting which passengers survived the Titanic in the test data.
